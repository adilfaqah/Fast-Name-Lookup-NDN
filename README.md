# Fast-Name-Lookup-NDN
The variable and unbounded nature of names in NDN, can introduce latency due to name lookup and have a very large memory footprint. This project explores using hash tables and Bloom filters combined with a novel consolidated root table to achieve significantly faster name look up and a reduced memory footprint.
